JavaBot-IRC
===========

An IRC bot, designed for simplicity and customizability.                     

Contents of this bot is as such:         
1. JavaBot          
2. PircBot (framework for JavaBot)         
3. openNLP                 
4. HSQLDB                
5. Jaspyt         
6. Java Simple Plugin Framework  
7. log4j
8. javaXT

(Don't worry, all are open source)                                        

1. Configure this bot.       
                
Edit the config file, "config.txt.template". Channels are seperated by spaces.          
Make sure you use a registered nick and that you have access to that nick.          
An utility to configure the config file will be coming soon.   

All commands will require the prefix you set in the config file.    

Once you're done with the configuration, rename:                      
files/config.txt.template -> config.txt                       
database/users.odb.template -> users.odb            
         
2. Running this bot         
         
Make sure you have JVM 7. Then, run java -jar JavaBot.jar & in the terminal. You need to run it in the background or          
else it may quit.         
         
3. Authenciating yourself         
         
Check in the terminal for the nick you have chosen in case the nick you chose isn't valid.         
         
Afterwards, copy the nick and send a private message to the nick in the terminal:         
useradd [your chosen username without brackets, may not be your nick] [password]         
         
JavaBot will return a message displaying the information you need to enter into the database. An example is this:         
"Add these details to the database: ID blahblahblah blahblahblah"         
         
Make sure OpenOffice Base/LibreOffice Base is installed. An utility to run SQL to edit those databases will be coming soon.         
         
Open up /database/users.odb and open table "users"         
         
Enter a suitable ID (since it is the primary key, do not include a duplicate ID. Increment the largest ID. 
For example, if the largest ID is 5, just use 6.) into the ID field, enter the 2nd parameter into the username 
field and enter the 3rd parameter into the password field.         
         
Now, authenciation is secured. You can log in through:         
login [your chosen username without brackets, may not be your nick] [password]"         

Once you're authenciated, you're done!         
         
To log out, simply do:         
logout     
         
You can skip authenciation, but beware, anyone can use JavaBot's quit, part, join commands.         
         
4. Learn the commands and features         
In JavaBot beta 1.5.0 a help feature has been introduced! Type help (make sure to prepend the prefix)

Here's the features:                       
Protection mode - Goes against anyone who bans/kicks the bot or sets an universal ban. Disabled by default.          
 - Edit "protectionMode" in config.txt         

5. Look at the logs.         
They are located at /logs/log_TIMESTAMP.txt
